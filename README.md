# ChaseOS2.0
Goodbye ChaseOS! Say hello to ChaseOS2.0.

# Features
ChaseOS2.0 has a new kernel, new everything. ChaseOS is no longer being updated either.

ChaseOS2.0 has its own interpreter!

# Kernel
ChaseOS used to pack all of its commands into the kernel. ChaseOS2.0 transfered the commands over for faster performance and organization.

# ChaseCode Library
This is a library that manages the interpreter of ChaseOS known as ChaseCode.

# Appstore
Will be in versions above V0.0.8

# Deprecation
ChaseOS2.0 is being updated to ChaseOS3.0 which is a full rewrite. So say good bye to this one.
